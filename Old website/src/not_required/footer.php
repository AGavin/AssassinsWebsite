<td class="footer">&copy;... Ah yes, &copy;, slightly complicated that. Well. Originally Elizabeth did lots of work and wrote most of the content of 
the site. Then Helen did some more, and Rory did some more after that, so the content could have been written by any of the three of them, or maybe by me. 
Where me is pilly, obviously. Anyway, one thing I am sure of is that the page images (on the left) and the big header image and the general look of 
the thing were all done by Beth Rowell, in 2008. The coding that makes it all work in the background was done by pilly between 2009 and 2012.<br><br>

The site is coded, maintained and hosted by <a href="mailto:webmaster@oules.lightentertainment.org">pilly</a>, contact me if you have any comments 
or questions about it, or if you find a broken link.<br><br>
